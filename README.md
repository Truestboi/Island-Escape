Welcome to Island Escape!
My first game!
This game was made by Amberly, Amari, and myself as our final project in our Girls Who Code 7 week program!
It might not be the best game in the world, but the code will be very useful for future projects.
Just have to note to myself not to ever use Cocos2d for anything ever again...
(It just doesn't have enough detailed information about how to use it and other game engines are loads easier)

Aaaanyways, you'll need to download the following before this game works when you run it:
-Python
-Pyglet
-Six (extension that works w/Python)
-Pygame
-Cocos2d (obviously)

Also the game was never actually exported, so you'll have to access it via the Command Prompt
